1.  Check task_group membership for tasks using a kernel module?
2.  Run Prof. Sudvarg's test code for four cpus in no_check_rt_group_sched kernel?
3.  Looking through the traces.
4.  Look through poly paper.
5.  cpu.max interface for group-v2
6.  70/100 70/100 what happens when the period expires and the second task hasn't
