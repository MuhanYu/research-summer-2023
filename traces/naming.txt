[is safe add?].[is manual?].<RT policy>.<number of nprocs processes>.<number of cgroups>.<number of cpus per cgroup>.<cpu.rt_runtime_us>

0.  Whether procs were added to cgroups safely (i.e. continuously add procs from
    the temporary PID file, stop only until the cgroups' "tasks" files have the
    same number of PIDs as spawned)

1.  Is manual means whether the processes change their policy through 
    sched_setscheduler() ("manual"), or, the processes are launched by schedtool.

2.  F - SCHED_FIFO
    R - SCHED_RR

3.  The number of nprocs processes should be a multiple of the number of cgroups.

4.  Each cgroup has (num_procs/num_cgroups) processes.

5.  Each cgroup is assigned one or two cpu(s) uniquely (although they do NOT 
    have exlusive access to the said cpus, i.e. cpuset.cpu_exclusive flag is
    NOT set).
